It's very difficult to find documentation on what is actually in master/release, as opposed to design proposals that are months/years old and partially implemented.	6	Honestly it's pretty great considering. I love that it's been dockerized so I don't have to worry about setting up all the tooling.	7	1. Disk space resource constraints! No way to protect against rogue disk users. 2. secrets are still really sub par. was fine as a placeholder, but it's very past due to have decent secret management.

I want to run clustered persistence on containers (cassandra, mongodb) - but how to set up, run those clusters, upgrade over time and keep services running - let alone scale the mongo or cassandra cluster is really opaque and I'm not sure I can do it yet with what's available.	No	5	I've just been PoC setups so far, but how to integrate Heapster, Prometheus, Grafana, etc - for effective monitoring is available, but hard to know what's useful to set up and no clear tasks for doing it with a local bare-metal K8S environment. Networking choices up front equally freaky and complex - or horrifically slow with the overlays		I like the project, I like the community, I think this has a tremendous amount of potential, and I'm very interested in continuing to build to help use k8s and improve it for others to use.

For example, in the case of AWS, subnets, security groups, worker IAM roles, encrypted EDS volumes, cloud-config.

No code gets committed without corresponding docs.	7	7	It's so large that it's hard to get the right people's attention when you have an issue or want to discuss a certain topic.	5	5		4		6	Finish implementing the "templates + parameterization" proposal. Allow replication controllers, deployments, and daemon sets, etc. to be restarted to pick up new configmap/secret changes without having to manually delete pods or "fake" a deployment by changing a dummy value.	No	5	Automation of cluster PKI assets. There is basically no solution for this right now and it's a huge pain. What happens when you need to renew certs? Rotate keys? Revoke a user's cert when they've left your company? etc.

The project start to have a good overall Documentation for the external APIs and other things, but everything internal like the way unit test and E2E tests work, or the way  local cluster is started for development etc are still very very difficult to consume	4	4	Very difficult to get started. There is a strong feeling that most of the people are part of an internal community that already decided what are the direction of the features/project. Small bug fixes are always welcome, though.	3	3	Internal ressource documentation (For Kubernetes devs getting started).	2	More documentation of core principle and core libraries (Api Machinery, go client, e2e tests....)	6	repo of working Yamls/Jsons. Everytime I have to use a new YAML/JSON for a ressource I end up googling for hours... I might actually do this myself in the coming days	Yes	3	a single repo with ALL the deployment/installation possibilities		Love the project and the community :-)

Particularly administrator impacting features.	6	5	Understanding when decisions are made and how decisions are made. 	3	6	The split repos are a mess and need to be reevaluated. Also we need some way to onboard more people and get them mentorship. There are a lot of cliques forming around subsystems.	6	The split repos need to be reconsidered they are creating churn and confusion. The client has been underway for two releases and is still useless 	7	Transactions across multiple objects and more customization of deployments.	Yes	6

For example, releaser czar needs to be a committer.	7	7	Not an issue, i'm an OG	3	5	Onboarding new people.  Feature process is difficult to understand / nuts. 	7	We need to imorove virtually every facet of the development process. Making the core smaller would cut umerius time sinks (builds, smaller use case footprint in main repo -> fewer e2e tests, faster ci runs, etc. 	5	Make it easier to use ssl/tls with zero work	No	4			Plenty
